  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Founded on July 5, 1967 by Archbishop Teodulfo S. Domingo, Lyceum of Aparri began as a response to community needs in coastal towns. Starting with just secondary education, Liberal Arts, and Business Administration, the institution has grown into Northern Luzon's premier Catholic educational center.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Through visionary leadership under figures like Msgr. Diosdado A. Talamayan and Rev. Fr. Joel M. Reyes, the school expanded significantly. Key milestones include establishing the Lyceum of Aparri Hospital in 1980, achieving Level II Accreditation status in 1988, and continuously adding diverse programs from Engineering and Nursing to Computer Science and Maritime studies.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Today, Lyceum of Aparri stands as the largest diocesan-run learning institution in Northern Luzon, recognized among the Top Ten schools in Region 02. It maintains memberships in prestigious educational associations including CEAP, PAGE, and PACU, continuing its mission of providing quality Catholic education while adapting to evolving community needs.
